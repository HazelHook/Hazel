- General focus: webhooks. Try to understand the issues companies have with webhooks and how they currently try to solve them.
- Understand the limitations of current solutions, if there are any.
- Do not talk about features. Don’t ask about “the optimal feature”, just try to get the best understanding possible on the problem.

# Outcome

Create a transcript for each interview. Not word-for-word, but a detailed collection of all the points that were made.

After the first outreach campaign, group the feedback, analyze it, and try to create a good solution. Build an MVP and outreach to these customers again for a demo.

# Technical Implementation

- SendStack: Resend ⇒ react-email
- Analytics ⇒ Resend Webhook ⇒ Tinybird ⇒ Timeseries dashboard
