# What is Hazel?

Hazel provides a way for you to better manage your webhook architecture and not fight against webhooks anymore. 
Webhooks is a simple concept, but brings a lot of complexity, verification of webhooks signings, webhook ratelimiting, failed retries,
required delay with your database. 
All of these are real world problems anyone faces working a lot with webhooks and we are here to solve them for you.
