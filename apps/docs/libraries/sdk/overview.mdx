## Hazel Workspace Secret

When a Webhook is handled with Hazel a Hazel Signature will be added
to be verified in your Destination, our SDK does that for you automatically.

You can find your Workspace Secret in your [settings](https://app.hazel.sh/settings), all you have todo now is
add the secret key to your Environment.

```ts
HAZEL_SECRET_KEY="YOUR ID"
```

Always keep your secret key safe and reset it `if` you suspect it has been compromised.
