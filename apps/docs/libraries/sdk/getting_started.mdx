First you need to install the SDK itself this is the same for every evironment you are in.

## 1. Install Hazel SDK

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="npm">
  ```bash
   npm install @hazelapp/sdk
  ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="pnpm">
  ```bash
   pnpm add @hazelapp/sdk
  ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="yarn">
  ```bash
   yarn add @hazelapp/sdk
  ```
  </Tab>
    <Tab title="bun">
    ```bash
    bun install @hazelapp/sdk
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>


## 2. Access your Hazel Workspace Secret

When a Webhook is handled with Hazel a Hazel Signature will be added
to be verified in your Destination, our SDK does that for you automatically.

You can find your Workspace Secret in your [settings](https://app.hazel.sh/settings), 
please add this as seen below as a Environment Variable to your APP

```ts
HAZEL_SECRET_KEY="YOUR ID"
```


## 3. Initiate Hazel Client

Create a new file to initate the Hazel Client, you will need to add an ID, the id is 
the identifier you have choosen earlier for your Destination, this can also be found again 
on your


```ts hazel.ts
import { Hazel } from "@hazelapp/sdk"

const hazel = new Hazel({ id: "test" })
```
