## How Sources Work in Hazel

Creating a source in Hazel is a simple yet crucial step in managing your webhooks.

- **Unique URL Assignment**: Upon creating a source, Hazel provides a unique URL. This URL is used to configure webhook settings in your third-party service.
- **Webhook Forwarding**: After configuration, Hazel begins receiving webhooks from your third-party service. These webhooks are then forwarded to all connected destinations.
- **Ease of Setup**: Configuring your third-party service with Hazel's unique URL is the only step needed to start managing your webhooks through Hazel.
