# ⭐️ Why Hazel
Hazel revolutionizes the way you manage webhooks, streamlining your workflow and unifying their infrastructure. In the modern software development landscape, integrating numerous third-party services has become the norm, and syncing these services through webhooks to your services is the most common occourence. However, the implementation of webhooks often varies, and when multiple third-party services are used, the complexity can quickly become overwhelming. This makes monitoring and managing these webhooks an impossible task.

In the worst-case scenario, a malfunctioning connection could go unnoticed for weeks, which could mean data being lost or your entire system getting out of sync. 
This is where Hazel steps in as your ultimate solution. 
Hazel adeptly manages all your webhooks, ensuring they are not only observable but also predictable. 
It elevates your webhook infrastructure with a unified feature and rule set, including retries, rate limiting, delays, and more, ensuring a seamless experience.

Getting started with Hazel is incredibly straightforward and flexible. You can begin by integrating a few new webhooks and then seamlessly incorporate your existing ones at a later point. 
This gradual approach allows you to adapt to Hazel's system without any disruptions.
